# Sentry Auto-Fix with GitHub Copilot
# =============================================================================
#
# When Sentry creates a GitHub issue, this workflow auto-assigns it to Copilot.
# Copilot coding agent then investigates the error and opens a draft fix PR.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Sentry GitHub integration enabled (auto-creates issues with stack traces)
#   2. GitHub Copilot subscription (Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise)
#
# How it works:
#   Sentry error → alert fires → GitHub issue created → workflow comments
#   @copilot → Copilot agent reads issue + codebase → creates draft fix PR
# =============================================================================
