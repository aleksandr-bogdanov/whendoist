## [0.8.3] - 2026-01-15

### Summary
**E2E Encryption Rewrite** — Complete rewrite of the encryption architecture from per-record flags to a global toggle model. Includes comprehensive tests for multitenancy isolation and domain name encryption.

### Changed

- **Global Toggle Model** — Replaced per-record encryption flags (`title_encrypted`, `description_encrypted`, `name_encrypted`) with a single global toggle (`encryption_enabled`). When enabled, ALL task titles, descriptions, and domain names are encrypted; when disabled, ALL data is plaintext. No mixed state possible.

- **Domain Name Encryption** — Domain/project names are now encrypted alongside task content:
  - Task list shows 🔒 placeholder when encrypted
  - Decryption happens on page load via `crypto.js`
  - Settings page domain CRUD functions encrypt/decrypt names

- **Batch Update Endpoints** — New endpoints for enable/disable encryption operations:
  - `GET /api/tasks/all-content` — Fetch all tasks and domains for batch encrypt/decrypt
  - `POST /api/tasks/batch-update` — Update multiple tasks in one request
  - `POST /api/domains/batch-update` — Update multiple domains in one request

### Added

- **48 Comprehensive Encryption Tests** (`tests/test_encryption.py`):
  - `TestEncryptionPreferences` — Enable/disable encryption state
  - `TestEncryptionMultitenancy` — **CRITICAL**: User isolation verification
  - `TestEncryptionDataIsolation` — Query scoping for all-content endpoint
  - `TestCryptoModuleExportsAPI` — crypto.js exports required functions
  - `TestCryptoModuleArchitecture` — Verifies AES-GCM, PBKDF2, sessionStorage
  - `TestCryptoModuleIntegration` — Templates use Crypto correctly
  - `TestEncryptionFlows` — Enable/disable encryption workflows
  - `TestEncryptionEdgeCases` — Empty batch, nonexistent IDs, re-enable
  - `TestEncryptionDataModel` — No per-record flags (global toggle only)

- **Encryption Documentation**:
  - `README.md` — User-facing encryption explanation with database examples
  - `DESIGN.md` — Full architecture documentation with flow diagrams
  - `tests/README.md` — Encryption test documentation
  - `CLAUDE.md` — Constraints and must-haves for future development

### Removed

- **Per-Record Encryption Flags** — Removed from models:
  - `Task.title_encrypted`
  - `Task.description_encrypted`
  - `Domain.name_encrypted`

### Technical

- Added `window.WHENDOIST` global config in `base.html` for encryption state
- Updated all task list partials (`_task_list.html`, `_scheduled_tasks.html`, `_completed_tasks.html`, `_deleted_tasks.html`) with `data-domain-name` attribute for JS decryption
- Updated `dashboard.html` with domain name decryption on page load
- Updated `settings.html` domain CRUD with encryption/decryption
- Updated `task-dialog.js` `loadDomains()` to decrypt domain names
- Fixed route ordering: `/api/tasks/all-content` must be defined before `/{task_id}`

### Security

- All batch update endpoints verify task/domain ownership via `user_id` filter
- `get_task(id)` and `get_domain(id)` return `None` for IDs not owned by authenticated user
- Batch updates silently skip unowned IDs (no error, no modification)

---

## [0.8.2] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- **OAuth Callback Error** — Fixed global exception handler catching HTTPException, which broke OAuth redirects (Todoist connect showed "Internal server error" even though it worked)

---

## [0.8.1] - 2026-01-13

### Summary
**Hotfix** — Improved logging and fixed database connection pool issues.

### Fixed

- **Database Connection Stability** — Fixed "connection is closed" errors:
  - Added `pool_pre_ping=True` to detect and recycle stale connections
  - Added `pool_recycle=300` to refresh connections every 5 minutes
  - Configured proper `pool_size` and `max_overflow` settings
- **Clean Exception Logging** — Readable tracebacks instead of wall of text:
  - Filters out library internals, shows only app code
  - Clean box format with exception type, message, and traceback
  - Global exception handler returns proper 500 JSON response
- **Quieter Logs** — Reduced noise from asyncpg and uvicorn.access loggers

---
