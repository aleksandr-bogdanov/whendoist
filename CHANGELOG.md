## v0.55.54 — 2026-02-28

### Fix: Mobile touch targets too small in header, triage drawer, and calendar

Header action buttons (theme toggle, logout) enlarged from ~26px to 44px touch targets on mobile using responsive classes (`p-3 md:p-1.5`, `h-5 w-5 md:h-3.5 md:w-3.5`). Triage drawer chips and buttons (domain, impact, schedule, duration, clarity, parent task) bumped from `py-1.5` (~32px) to `py-2` (~36px). Calendar nav arrows increased from `h-9 w-9` to `h-10 w-10`. Parent picker search bar and clear button also enlarged. Desktop sizes unchanged.

---

## v0.55.53 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Domain flash animation uses React state instead of imperactive DOM

The domain row flash (triggered when a parent task auto-switches the domain) was barely visible — hex `#color15` produced only 8% opacity. Replaced imperative `el.style` manipulation with React state-driven class toggling (`bg-primary/20`), leveraging the existing `transition-all duration-300` for a smooth fade in/out. Removed unused `domainRowRef`.

---

## v0.55.52 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Remove domain-switch toast that covered triage drawer buttons

The toast fired when a parent task auto-switched the domain was rendered at the global `bottom-right` position, covering the drawer's footer buttons. The domain row flash animation already provides sufficient in-context feedback. Removed the toast; the flash stays.

---

## v0.55.51 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Triage drawer — Convert button uses primary color, domain chips redesigned

"Convert to Task" button now uses the app's primary color instead of the domain color (which could be gray). Domain chips switched from domain-colored backgrounds to neutral `bg-secondary` with `primary` selected state. Domain row left padding aligned with other field rows (54px → 58px).

---

## v0.55.50 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Fast scrolling causes entire page to rubber-band on iOS

Added `overscroll-behavior: contain` to the scroll container. Prevents scroll chaining to the body when hitting scroll bounds.

---

## v0.55.49 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Input bar hijacks scroll on mobile — structural fix

Root cause: `fixed` positioning placed the input outside the scroll container's DOM tree. Touch events on it propagated to the body instead of the thoughts scroll container, causing the header to shift while the list froze. Fix: moved input inside the scroll container using `sticky bottom-[X]`. Scroll container is now `flex flex-col` with `flex-1` on the list wrapper to push input to the bottom when the list is short. Added a clearance spacer for scroll past the input.

---

## v0.55.48 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Floating input scrolls with content on mobile touch

Changed input container from `absolute` to `fixed` positioning so it's locked to the viewport like the bottom nav, preventing it from getting dragged during scroll momentum on mobile Safari.

---

## v0.55.47 — 2026-02-27

### Feat: Glossier bottom nav + glassy input container

Bottom nav: 80px blur, saturate 2.2, specular top border for glossy depth. Input bar container is now glassy (backdrop-blur + translucent white tint) matching the nav, while Input and Button stay opaque.

---

## v0.55.46 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Thoughts fade extends to screen edge + much glassier header and nav

Fade gradient now extends 384px with only 50% opacity at the bottom — items are visible all the way to the safe area instead of vanishing at the nav midpoint. Header glass dropped from 80% to 25% opacity with `backdrop-blur-3xl`. Nav tint lowered to 20% opacity for true see-through glass.

---

## v0.55.45 — 2026-02-27

### Feat: Apple Glass treatment for thoughts page + bottom nav

Thoughts header is now a glassy sticky bar — content scrolls behind it with backdrop-blur. Floating input bar has a solid opaque background with ring + shadow. Bottom nav is significantly glassier (lower tint opacity, stronger blur).

---

## v0.55.44 — 2026-02-27

### Feat: Floating input + infinite fade on thoughts page (mobile)

Thoughts list now extends to the bottom with a gradient fade-out mimicking Apple's glass infinite canvas. The "What's on your mind?" input floats above the bottom nav on mobile. Desktop layout unchanged.

---

## v0.55.43 — 2026-02-27

### Feat: Toast + flash animation when parent task auto-switches domain

When selecting a parent task from a different domain, the domain now visually flashes with the new domain's color and a toast confirms the switch (e.g. "Domain switched to 🎨 Design to match parent task").

---

## v0.55.42 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Triage drawer footer has no bottom padding in mobile web

`pb-safe` resolves to `env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px)` which is `0` in mobile web (no home indicator). Changed to `pb-[max(0.625rem,env(safe-area-inset-bottom))]` so the footer always has at least `0.625rem` bottom padding.

---

## v0.55.41 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Replace parent dropdown with nested drawer (tested on-device)

After testing 4 approaches on-device (A: nested drawer, B: onOpenChange guard, C: onPointerDownOutside, D: inline list), only the **nested drawer** worked on iOS PWA. Portaled dropdowns inside vaul drawers fundamentally can't work because Radix's DismissableLayer uses React synthetic capture events for inside/outside detection, and the timing breaks on iOS touch devices.

- Replaced `ParentTaskSelect` (portaled dropdown) with `ParentPickerDrawer` (nested bottom sheet via `Drawer.NestedRoot`)
- Preserved smart grouping logic (parents with subtasks first, same-domain priority)
- Added search bar in the nested picker
- Removed all `onPointerDownOutside`/`onInteractOutside` hacks from Drawer.Content
- Removed portal container state (`portalEl`)
- Removed test page (`/test-dropdown`) and temporary link

---

## v0.55.40 — 2026-02-27

### Test: Parent dropdown approach comparison page

Added `/test-dropdown` route with 4 different approaches for parent task selection inside a vaul drawer, testable on-device:
- **A: Nested Drawer** — parent picker as a nested bottom sheet (like calendar)
- **B: onOpenChange guard** — portal to body, suppress drawer close via ref flag
- **C: onPointerDownOutside** — portal inside Content + event interception (current approach)
- **D: Inline list** — no dropdown, scrollable list directly in drawer body

---

## v0.55.39 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Remove capture-phase listener that blocked parent dropdown on iOS

v0.55.38's capture-phase `pointerdown` listener on `document` prevented the parent dropdown from opening on iOS. Replaced with a simpler approach: check `e.detail.originalEvent.target` directly inside `onPointerDownOutside` and `onInteractOutside` callbacks. No global listeners, no refs — the dismiss suppression is now entirely self-contained in the event callbacks.

---

## v0.55.38 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Parent task dropdown — prevent vaul dismiss on option tap

The portal-inside-Drawer.Content approach (v0.55.37) placed the dropdown in the correct DOM subtree, but Radix's DismissableLayer still treated taps on dropdown options as "outside" clicks. Root cause: Radix uses its own layer stack rather than pure `Node.contains()`, so portaled elements aren't recognized as "inside" even when they're in the DOM tree.

Fix: Intercept vaul's `onPointerDownOutside` on `Drawer.Content`. A capture-phase `pointerdown` listener on `document` sets a ref flag when the tap target has `[data-vaul-no-drag]`. The `onPointerDownOutside` callback checks this flag and calls `e.preventDefault()`, which vaul propagates to Radix, suppressing the dismiss.

---

## v0.55.37 — 2026-02-27

### Fix: Parent dropdown actually works now + remove all keyboard hacking

Two root causes found and fixed:
1. **Portal was always null**: `useRef` for portal container was evaluated during render (when `.current` is still `null`). Since `ParentTaskSelect` manages its own `open` state, clicking the trigger re-renders ParentTaskSelect but NOT DrawerBody — so `portalRef.current` was never re-evaluated. The dropdown was ALWAYS portaling to `document.body`, making the v0.55.35 portal fix a complete no-op. Fixed by using `useState` as a callback ref (`ref={setPortalEl}`), which triggers a re-render when the element mounts.
2. **Removed all keyboard hacking**: Every approach (inline styles, spacer div) either fought vaul's transform animations or created stale state. Removed entirely. Set `repositionInputs={false}` to prevent vaul from interfering. The drawer is content-sized, clean open/close animation.

---

## v0.55.36 — 2026-02-26

### Fix: Replace inline style hacking with React-state keyboard spacer

**Root cause of jerkiness + stale gap**: Previous approach mutated `el.style.bottom` and `el.style.maxHeight` directly on vaul's `Drawer.Content` element, which fought with vaul's transform-based open/close animations (causing jerky appearance) and left stale inline styles between thoughts (causing the gap on second open). Replaced with a React state-controlled spacer `<div>` inside the flex column that pushes content above the keyboard — zero inline style mutation on vaul's element. `setKeyboardH(0)` in cleanup ensures clean slate between thoughts. Added `min-h-0` on scrollable body (enables flex-shrink when spacer is active) and `shrink-0` on footer (prevents it from collapsing).

---

## v0.55.35 — 2026-02-26

### Fix: Root-cause fixes for iOS triage drawer — portal, keyboard shift, cleanup

Three root-cause fixes:
1. **Dropdown portaled inside Drawer.Content**: The parent dropdown was portaled to `document.body`, causing vaul (via Radix Dialog) to treat every tap on a dropdown option as an "outside click" and dismiss the entire drawer. Now portals to a container inside `Drawer.Content` so containment checks pass. Added `data-vaul-no-drag` to prevent drag interference.
2. **Keyboard shifts drawer up**: Instead of only constraining `maxHeight` (which left the footer behind the keyboard), now sets `bottom: keyboardHeight` to physically move the drawer above the keyboard. The footer (Delete/Convert) is always visible.
3. **Stale style cleanup**: The viewport effect now clears `bottom` and `maxHeight` inline styles on cleanup, preventing the "second thought" bug where stale keyboard-era styles persisted to the next drawer open. Also runs `update()` immediately on mount.

---

## v0.55.34 — 2026-02-26

### Fix: Three remaining iOS triage drawer issues

1. **Keyboard gap in PWA mode**: Removed `flex-1` from scrollable body (was expanding to fill drawer height beyond content), removed separate `h-safe` spacer div, moved safe-area padding into footer with `pb-safe`. Added `window.resize` listener alongside `visualViewport.resize` since PWA standalone mode fires the former.
2. **Parent dropdown not scrollable**: Added `touch-action: pan-y`, `overscroll-behavior-y: contain`, and `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` to the options list. Added `onTouchMove` stop-propagation on the portaled dropdown to prevent vaul's drag gesture from capturing scroll events.
3. **Parent dropdown oversized**: Removed `maxHeight` from inline dropdown positioning styles — the inner `max-h-48` constrains the scrollable list, and the outer container now uses `overflow-hidden` to clip to content.

---

## v0.55.33 — 2026-02-26

### Fix: iOS keyboard breaks triage drawer layout and parent dropdown

Triage drawer now tracks `visualViewport.height` and dynamically constrains its max-height when the iOS keyboard is open — `vh` units refer to the layout viewport which doesn't shrink for the keyboard, causing the drawer to overflow behind it and push content off-screen. Parent task dropdown no longer auto-focuses the search input (which triggered the keyboard inside the drawer), and uses `visualViewport`-aware positioning with automatic above/below placement.

---

## v0.55.32 — 2026-02-26

### Fix: iOS auto-zoom on triage drawer inputs

Bumped triage drawer textarea and parent task search input from `text-sm` (14px) to `text-base` (16px). iOS Safari auto-zooms any input with font-size below 16px, causing the page layout to break.

---

## v0.55.31 — 2026-02-26

### Fix: Extended duration and date abbreviation parsing

Duration parser now supports spaced compound formats (`2h 30m`), and longer suffixes (`30min`, `1hr`, `2hrs`). Added date abbreviations: `tod` (today), `tom` (tomorrow), `yes`/`yest` (yesterday).

---

## v0.55.30 — 2026-02-26

### Fix: Domain symbol @ → #, triage drawer bug fixes

Changed domain token prefix from `@` to `#` (like Todoist) across parser, autocomplete, smart input hook, quick-add, and triage drawer. Fixed three triage drawer bugs: date replacement now uses dynamic token matching instead of static regex (handles chrono-node dates like "next friday"), duration replacement handles compound formats like `2h30m`, and changing domain via chip row now clears parent task if it's in a different domain.

---

## v0.55.29 — 2026-02-26

### Refactor: Bottom sheet triage drawer for thoughts

Replaced inline `ThoughtTriageCard` expansion (which consumed ~60% of iPhone viewport) with a vaul-based bottom sheet drawer that slides up as an overlay. Extracted reusable `DomainChipRow`, `ImpactButtonRow`, and `ScheduleButtonRow` picker components into `field-pickers.tsx`. Added collapsible "More options" section with duration and clarity pickers. Convert button now shows domain color. Thoughts page dropped from ~640 to ~340 lines — card list is now a simple flat list of tappable rows with swipe always enabled.

---

## v0.55.28 — 2026-02-26

### Fix: Thoughts triage panel clipping on iPhone SE

Removed two `overflow-hidden` declarations from the triage panel card wrapper and panel container that clipped domain chips, priority labels, and the Convert button at 375px width. Added `shrink-0` to domain chip buttons so flex wraps instead of shrinking text. Tightened mobile selector spacing to match panel rhythm.

---

## v0.55.27 — 2026-02-25

### Feat: Thoughts page redesign — inbox cards, smart input triage, mobile selectors

Replaced chat-bubble layout with full-width inbox card list. Triage panel uses shared `useSmartInput()` hook for inline metadata parsing (`#domain`, `!priority`, `?clarity`, `30m`, `tomorrow`, `//notes`). Mobile gets tappable domain pills, priority buttons, and schedule quick-picks below the smart input. Extracted `useSmartInput` hook from duplicated code in Quick Add and Thoughts, added CLAUDE.md rule 10 to prevent future duplication.

---

## v0.55.26 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Analytics query production readiness

Bounded three unbounded queries that degrade with scale: `_get_aging_stats` (LIMIT 5000), `_calculate_streaks` (2-year lookback), `get_recent_completions` (365-day cutoff). Added composite indexes `(user_id, status, completed_at)` on both Task and TaskInstance tables. Fixed median calculation bug, eliminated multiple `date.today()` calls, removed redundant DISTINCT in streaks query.

---

## v0.55.25 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Sticky header height jump when scrolling between sections

Fixed the task list sticky header (domain label + sort columns) changing height in real time when scrolling from domains to scheduled section. Added fixed height so the header size stays constant regardless of whether the domain label is visible.

---

## v0.55.24 — 2026-02-25

### Feat: Analytics page redesign

Complete visual overhaul of the analytics dashboard. Hero gradient card with animated count-up and sparkline. Section grouping (Overview/Patterns/Details) with divider lines. Asymmetric grids for visual hierarchy. Two new charts: Active Hours (area chart with gradient) and Resolution Time (donut chart replacing stacked bar). All chart cards have subtitles explaining the data, hover lift effects, and proper tooltip styling (solid background, box shadow). Domain donut no longer clips. Sticky header with Apple glass effect keeps range selector accessible while scrolling. Range switching uses `keepPreviousData` for seamless transitions. Impact colors updated to match brand spec (P4 Min = grey). Recurring tasks show progress bars. Velocity chart has a visible legend.

---

## v0.55.23 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Wizard swipe animation and polish

Replaced simple fade transition with directional slide animation (translateX + opacity). Added smooth height animation between steps of different sizes — locks current height before content swap, measures new content, animates between them. Fixed Radix Dialog Portal timing: replaced `useRef` + `useEffect` (ref was null on mount) with callback ref pattern. Swipe at boundaries: back on first step is a no-op, forward on last step triggers finish. Button glow no longer clipped — `overflow-hidden` only applied during active transitions.

---

## v0.55.22 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Wizard swipe — use native event listeners

Replaced React synthetic `onPointerDown`/`onPointerUp` with native `addEventListener` for both touch and pointer events, following the same pattern as the calendar carousel. Touch events (`touchstart`/`touchend`) handle mobile swipe; `pointerdown` on the wrapper + `pointerup` on `document` handles desktop mouse drag (skips buttons/inputs). Wheel/trackpad handler unchanged.

---

## v0.55.21 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Restore original wizard layout with swipe support

Reverted wizard back to original one-step-at-a-time conditional rendering (pre-swipe changes). The simultaneous panel rendering (both scroll-snap and transform approaches) broke layout and scrolling. Swipe/wheel navigation is now layered on top of the original structure: wheel events with 800ms cooldown for desktop trackpad, pointer swipe detection for touch. Both trigger the same `goForward`/`goBack` that buttons use.

---

## v0.55.20 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Wizard swipe — replace native scroll with transform

Replaced `overflow-x: auto` + CSS `scroll-snap` with `overflow: hidden` + CSS `transform: translateX()`. Native scroll-snap couldn't handle macOS trackpad momentum — hard swipes flew to the last panel. Transform approach gives full control: one panel per gesture, no momentum overshoot. Dots now driven directly by React state instead of scroll position events.

---

## v0.55.19 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Wizard swipe infinite scroll and layout centering

Fixed two wizard issues: (1) Trackpad/mousewheel caused infinite scrolling because raw pixel deltas were piped to `scrollBy` — now snaps one panel at a time with a 600ms cooldown. (2) Content was top-aligned with empty space below — panels now use `flex flex-col justify-center` to vertically center content.

---

## v0.55.18 — 2026-02-25

### Chore: `just dev` runs both backend and frontend

`just dev` now starts both the backend (port 8000) and frontend dev server (port 5173) in parallel. Ctrl+C stops both. The old backend-only command is available as `just dev-backend`.

---

## v0.55.17 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Wizard swipe on macOS trackpad

Wheel handler now picks whichever axis has the larger delta (`deltaX` vs `deltaY`), so macOS trackpad horizontal two-finger swipe works alongside vertical mousewheel.

---

## v0.55.16 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: User preferences race condition and cascade delete

Fixed two user_preferences bugs: (1) Race condition where concurrent requests for the same user both tried to INSERT preferences, causing UniqueViolationError — now uses savepoint with IntegrityError retry. (2) Demo user cleanup setting user_id to NULL instead of cascading delete — added `cascade="all, delete-orphan"` to User relationships missing it (preferences, todoist_token, google_token, calendar_selections). Fixes #480, #481, #486, #487, #493, #494.

---

## v0.55.15 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Analytics page colors and scroll

Fixed charts rendering as black instead of brand purple — all chart fills/strokes now use `--color-brand` (#6D5EF6). Fixed page not scrolling by replacing Radix ScrollArea with native overflow. Updated recurring rate colors to use brand purple for success states.

---

## v0.55.14 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Restore wizard nav buttons alongside swipe

Restored Back/Next/Skip/Get Started buttons that were removed in v0.55.13. Buttons now coexist with horizontal scroll-snap — users can swipe or use buttons.

---

## v0.55.13 — 2026-02-25

### Feat: Swipeable setup wizard

Replaced button-based wizard navigation (Back/Next/Skip) with horizontal scroll-snap. Swipe on mobile, scroll on desktop. Progress dots track position. Action buttons (Connect Calendar, Connect Todoist, Open Tasks) remain.

---

## v0.55.12 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Demo seed data — add unscheduled domain tasks

Moved 8 tasks from scheduled to unscheduled and added 3 new backlog tasks so demo users see content in domain areas, not just in the calendar.

---

## v0.55.11 — 2026-02-25

### Feat: Smart Quick Add V2

Redesigned Quick Add as an intelligent single-field input with inline metadata parsing. Type naturally and metadata is extracted automatically.

- **Syntax**: `#Domain` `!high` `?auto` `30m` `tomorrow` `// description`
- **Autocomplete**: Dropdown for `@` domains, `?` clarity, `!` impact
- **Metadata pills**: Colored dismissable pills below input showing parsed tokens
- **chrono-node date guard**: Rejects ambiguous bare month names ("Jan", "May") that could be person names — only accepts dates with a certain day, weekday, or hour
- **Sticky dismissals**: Pill dismissals persist while their trigger text remains in the input (Map-based tracking instead of clearing on every keystroke)
- **Double-submit guard**: `isPending` check on both Enter key and `handleSave` prevents duplicate task creation
- **Keep-open mode**: Checkbox to stay open for batch creation (persisted to localStorage)
- **Syntax hints**: Dismissable reference row below pills

New files: `task-parser.ts` (pure parsing logic), `smart-input-autocomplete.tsx` (dropdown component)
New dependency: `chrono-node` (natural language date parsing)

## v0.55.10 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Vertically center subtask count badge
- Badge button was a block element — changed to `inline-flex items-center` so the flex parent's `items-center` can properly center it

## v0.55.9 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Remove duplicate subtask count from clarity column
- Parent task rows had active/total count in both the title-area badge and the clarity column — removed the clarity column duplicate
- Subtask count badge now always shows `active/total` format (was only showing total when not hiding completed)
- Added `self-center` to the subtask count badge button for proper vertical centering

## v0.55.8 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Center clarity/duration/impact pills in column cells
- Autopilot and Brainstorm clarity pills were left-aligned because `text-center` on the wrapper doesn't properly center `inline-flex` elements that overflow the fixed column width
- Switched all metadata column wrappers from `text-center` to `flex justify-center` for proper centering regardless of pill width

## v0.55.7 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Align sticky domain label with actual domain names
- Added `pl-9` (36px) to sticky domain label to match the left offset of domain names in cards (content padding + card border + trigger padding + chevron + gap)

## v0.55.6 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Task rows painting above sticky header
- Framer-motion `layout` prop on task rows creates promoted compositing layers (`will-change: transform`) that escaped the sticky header's backdrop-filter
- Added `isolate` on the task content container to trap compositing layers in their own stacking context
- Bumped sticky header to `z-20` so it paints above all task content

## v0.55.5 — 2026-02-25

### Fix: Sticky header glass effect + clarity column alignment
- Sticky sort header now has proper glass surface (`backdrop-blur-lg` 16px + 90% opacity) so domain headers don't show through
- Fixed clarity column alignment: `calc()` padding values had no spaces around `+` operator, generating invalid CSS that the browser ignored — switched to explicit pixel values (`pr-[9px] sm:pr-[17px]`)

## v0.55.4 — 2026-02-25

### Feat: Sticky domain label in column headers + alignment fix
- Domain name, emoji, and task count now fade into the sticky sort header as you scroll past each domain section (desktop, matching legacy behavior)
- Fixed column header alignment: Clarity/Duration/Impact labels now align precisely with task row metadata pills (was shifted ~15px left at large breakpoints)

## v0.55.3 — 2026-02-25

### Chore: Overhaul demo seed data
- Expanded domains from 4 to 5 (Work, Health & Fitness, Personal, Side Project, Learning)
- Doubled recurring tasks from 4 to 8 with realistic schedules (standup, gym, 1:1, sprint review, meal prep, water plants, coding sessions, reading)
- Dense calendar coverage: 8 tasks today, 6 tomorrow, decreasing density through day+5
- Added 3 overdue tasks, 6 archived tasks, 5 subtasks under 2 parent tasks, 6 thoughts
- Made seeding deterministic via `random.seed(user_id)` — same demo data on every reset
- Coherent persona: Alex Chen, senior PM at a tech startup

## v0.55.1 — 2026-02-24

### Chore: Task panel UX cleanup
- Moved sort controls (Clarity/Duration/Impact) from toolbar into a sticky column header row aligned with task metadata
- Removed gradient separator under task panel header (border-b is sufficient)
- Removed colored clarity dots from energy selector (duplicated toggle icons)
- Removed "+ Quick" button from toolbar (Thoughts page handles quick add)
- Increased section separator spacing for Scheduled/Completed/Deleted sections

## v0.55.0 — 2026-02-24

### Fix: Completed section disappears when retention filter matches zero tasks
- Changed early-return guard from `filtered.length === 0` to `tasks.length === 0` so the header and retention buttons stay visible even when the current filter window has no matches

## v0.54.99 — 2026-02-24

### Fix: Illustration SVGs not served in production
- Mounted `/illustrations` static directory from SPA dist so SVGs are served directly instead of falling through to SPA fallback (which returned HTML)
- Added `illustrations/`, `assets/`, `icons/` to SPA fallback exclusion list

## v0.54.98 — 2026-02-24

### Fix: Demo login 500 error + landing page readability + animation tweaks
- **Demo login crash**: Added `passive_deletes=True` to all User relationships — SQLAlchemy was trying to null-out FKs before DB CASCADE could fire during demo user cleanup
- **Landing task cards**: Changed from white to muted background with subtle shadow for contrast against hero illustration
- **Rocket animation**: Slowed from 0.6s to 1.2s with gentler float-up-and-settle curve
- **Thoughts glow**: Sped up from 5s to 3s cycle
- **Empty tasks entrance**: More noticeable — added translateY + larger scale change, 0.6s duration

## v0.54.97 — 2026-02-24

### Feat: Subtle animations for empty states and illustrations
- Empty tasks: fade-in + scale entrance animation (0.4s, one-shot)
- Empty thoughts: entrance + glacial brightness glow pulse (5s cycle)
- Onboarding rocket: slide-up entrance with ease-out overshoot (0.6s, one-shot)
- Onboarding logo float slowed from 3s to 5s for calmer feel
- All new animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

## v0.54.96 — 2026-02-24

### Fix: PWA update toast keeps reappearing after reload
- Switched service worker from `registerType: "prompt"` to `autoUpdate` — updates apply silently in background
- Removed `PwaReloadPrompt` component and persistent "New version available" toast

## v0.54.95 — 2026-02-24

### Feat: Task panel header cleanup and UX improvements
- Removed FilterBar (SCHEDULED/COMPLETED toggle buttons) and SettingsPanel (gear menu) — redundant with section-level controls
- Restructured task panel header to single row: Energy selector + Sort controls + action buttons
- Moved completed retention days (1d/3d/7d) to CompletedSection header — contextually discoverable
- Dashboard now fetches `status=all` so completed tasks persist across page refresh
- Created shared `dashboardTasksKey()` for consistent query invalidation across all task components
- DeletedSection: limited to 15 items by default with "Show all" link; reads `X-Total-Count` header
- Backend: added `limit`/`offset` query params and `X-Total-Count` header to `GET /api/v1/tasks`
- Extracted `_build_task_filters()` and added `count_tasks()` to TaskService
- Added per-parent "hide completed subtasks" toggle on the subtask count badge
- Removed "Hide recurring after done" setting (meaningless in current architecture)

---

## v0.54.94 — 2026-02-24

### Feat: Add illustrations to empty states and error boundaries
- Created reusable `EmptyState` component (`frontend/src/components/ui/empty-state.tsx`)
- Added illustrations to: empty task list, empty thoughts, analytics load failure, root and app error boundaries
- Copied 4 brand SVGs from legacy `static/img/illustrations/` to `frontend/public/illustrations/`

---

## v0.54.93 — 2026-02-24

### Fix: Demo cleanup uses index-friendly query and CASCADE deletes
- Cleanup query uses `startswith("demo-")` instead of `endswith("@whendoist.local")` — B-tree index compatible
- Cleanup relies on `ondelete=CASCADE` instead of manual 10-table deletes — future-proof when new tables are added
- Added missing `ExportSnapshot` delete to `_clear_user_data` (used by demo reset)

## v0.54.92 — 2026-02-24

### Feat: Multi-tenant demo users (unique per session)
- Each demo login creates a fresh user with unique email `demo-{profile}-{uuid}@whendoist.local` — no more shared state between concurrent sessions
- Added `cleanup_stale_users()` that lazily deletes demo users older than 24h (configurable via `DEMO_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_HOURS`)
- Added `extract_profile()` to parse profile from both new and legacy email formats
- 21 tests covering creation, reset, cleanup, and isolation

---

## v0.54.91 — 2026-02-24

### Feat: Demo users always start with onboarding wizard
- Demo login now sets `wizard_completed=False` so the onboarding wizard shows on every demo session
- Returning demo users get wizard reset on login; demo reset also resets wizard state

---

## v0.54.90 — 2026-02-24

### Feat: Landing page redesign + demo login fix
- Ported legacy landing page design to React SPA: hero animation (task→calendar transfer), brand wordmark (Quicksand), value proposition, gradient CTA, trust/features meta block
- Added `demo_login_enabled` to build-info API so "Try Demo Account" button actually appears when enabled
- New `frontend/src/styles/login.css` with all animation keyframes, dark mode, and `prefers-reduced-motion` support

---

## v0.54.89 — 2026-02-24

### Fix: Child task editor opens on click
- Task editor's "close if deleted" guard only checked top-level tasks, causing it to immediately close when opening a child task
- Now also checks `subtasks` arrays so child tasks are recognized as existing

---

## v0.54.88 — 2026-02-24

### Feat: Allow editing completed tasks via metadata pills
- Removed `disabled={isCompleted}` from Impact, Clarity, and Duration pills for both tasks and subtasks
- Completed tasks now have interactive metadata pills — users can change values without reopening

---

## v0.54.87 — 2026-02-24

### Feat: Redesign onboarding wizard to match legacy design
- Ported polished legacy wizard design: Whendoist logo with float animation, branded SVGs (rocket, Google Calendar, Todoist), glassmorphic cards, purple gradient CTA buttons
- Welcome step: logo wordmark + personalized greeting + value proposition card
- Energy step: 3 horizontal selectable mode cards with live task preview (color-coded accent bars)
- Calendar step: branded connection card with Google icon, status indicator, privacy notice
- Todoist step: centered branded card with Todoist logo
- Domains step: 3-column suggestion chip grid with emoji picker for custom domains
- Completion step: rocket illustration + pulsing "Open Tasks" button
- Added `logoFloat` and `finalPulse` CSS keyframe animations with reduced-motion support
- Renamed FOCUS energy label to BRAINSTORM

---

## v0.54.86 — 2026-02-24

### Fix: Legacy frontend CSP inline script blocking
- Legacy Jinja2 templates use inline event handlers (`onclick`, `onchange`, etc.) incompatible with nonce-based CSP
- `render_template` now flags legacy pages via `request.state.legacy_template`
- CSP middleware uses `'unsafe-inline'` for legacy pages, nonce-based for React SPA

---

## v0.54.85 — 2026-02-24

### Fix: V4 audit findings (7 of 8)
- **Input validation**: Added field validators to `TaskContentData` and `DomainContentData` batch models (control char stripping + length limits)
- **Domain icon validation**: Added `@field_validator("icon")` to `DomainCreate` and `DomainUpdate` (50 char limit, control char stripping)
- **Retention days**: Changed `completed_retention_days` from `Field(ge=1, le=7)` to `Literal[1, 3, 7]`
- **Rate limit interval leak**: Store interval ID at module level, clear before creating new countdown
- **Backup completeness**: Added `encryption_unlock_method` to backup export/import
- **Undo error handling**: Added `onError` toast to toggle-complete and instance reschedule undo callbacks

---

## v0.54.84 — 2026-02-24

### Docs: Pre-1.0 cleanup
- Merged `docs/archive/` into `docs/plans/` (single location for all historical docs)
- Created `docs/scratchpad/` for HTML mockups (consolidated from archive + frontend/mockups)
- Compacted CHANGELOG from 1078 to ~490 lines (v0.54.x: 83 entries → 6 grouped sections)
- Removed root `openapi.json` from git (orval fetches from running server)
- Removed `e2e/` directory (no E2E tests per project philosophy)
- Fixed README: removed stale "Due" property, corrected tsc command, "Thought Cabinet" → "Thoughts"
- Updated POST-1.0-BACKLOG: removed completed items (nonce CSP, recurrence_rule validation)
- Renamed misnamed plan files to follow `yyyy-mm-dd-name.md` convention

---

## v0.54.79–v0.54.83 — 2026-02-24

### Production Hardening

- **Error boundary** with friendly "Something went wrong" page
- **Code splitting**: Route-based lazy loading + vendor chunk separation (1,546 KB → 350 KB initial)
- **PWA reload prompt**: User-controlled update instead of silent auto-update
- **Nonce-based CSP**: Replaced `'unsafe-inline'` in `script-src` with per-request nonces
- **Input validation**: Recurrence rule schema, domain color format, expanded subtask set cap
- **UX guards**: Double-tap completion guard, CSRF auto-retry, stale data prevention, editor auto-close
- **Encryption**: Decrypt all UI surfaces (dashboard, calendar, settings, thoughts, analytics), mask content in GCal sync
- **CI**: Fixed TypeScript check to use `tsconfig.app.json`

---

---

## v0.54.33–v0.54.55 — 2026-02-22/23

### DnD Reparenting & Calendar Polish

**Drag-and-drop reparenting:**
- Drag task onto task → make subtask; drag subtask to different parent → reparent; drag to gap → promote
- Ghost placeholder, gap zone hitboxes (8px → 28px), overlay fade on hover
- Badge text adapts: "Make subtask" / "Change parent" / "Drop to make standalone"
- All operations with undo toast and optimistic updates

**Subtask enhancements:**
- Subtask-aware sorting (parent ranks by best pending subtask value)
- Energy filter applies to subtasks (not just parents)
- Drag-drop reschedule in scheduled section (between date groups)

**Calendar:**
- Completed tasks/instances stay visible (opacity + strikethrough)
- Undo on all completion/skip toasts with instance dates
- Anytime section: vertical wrap, grid→flexbox, label alignment
- GCal event click fix (use `htmlLink` from API)
- Card style A/B test (4 approaches), settled on impact-colored tints
- Consistent 3px left borders, border clipping fixes

**Task creation:**
- Optimistic add-task (stable key from API response, no flicker)
- Undo on task creation toast

**Recurring:**
- Regenerate instances on start/end date change
- Sync `recurrence_start` when `scheduled_date` changes
- Recurring parent tasks hidden from calendar (instances only)

**Backend:**
- Savepoints for IntegrityError handlers (no silent transaction loss)
- Instance unskip endpoint

---

## v0.54.6–v0.54.32 — 2026-02-21/22

### Data Model Cleanup & iOS PWA

**Data model:**
- Removed `due_date`/`due_time` — `scheduled_date` is single source of truth
- DB migration drops columns, Todoist import simplified

**Recurring tasks:**
- Overdue based on pending instances (not recurrence start date)
- Instance-aware grouping in scheduled sections
- Skip/complete available for all recurring tasks (not just overdue)
- "Unschedule" hidden for recurring tasks
- Instance drag & unschedule in calendar view
