                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Google Account Information:</strong>
                    When you sign in with Google, we receive your email address, name,
                    and profile picture. This is used to create and identify your account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tasks and Content:</strong>
                    Tasks, domains, descriptions, and preferences you create within
                    the Service are stored to provide functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Google Calendar Data:</strong>
                    With your permission, we access your Google Calendar events to display
                    them alongside your tasks. If you enable calendar sync, we also create
                    a secondary "Whendoist" calendar to sync your tasks to Google Calendar.
                    We never modify or delete your personal calendar events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Todoist Data:</strong>
                    If you choose to import from Todoist, we access your Todoist tasks
                    for a one-time import. We do not retain Todoist API credentials after
                    the import is complete.
                </p>

                <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the Service</li>
                    <li>To display your calendar events alongside your tasks</li>
                    <li>To sync your tasks to Google Calendar (if you enable this)</li>
                    <li>To sync your task data across your own devices</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or analytics beyond basic service operation.</p>

                <h2>3. Google API Services User Data</h2>
                <p>
                    Whendoist's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs
                    adheres to the
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy"
                       target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>,
                    including the Limited Use requirements.
                </p>
                <p>Specifically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We only request the scopes necessary to provide the Service
                        (calendar read, or calendar read-write if you enable sync)</li>
                    <li>We do not sell, lease, or share Google user data with third parties</li>
                    <li>We do not use Google user data for advertising or to build user profiles</li>
                    <li>Google OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest and only used to access
                        the Google APIs on your behalf</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
                <p>
                    Your data is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on
                    <a href="https://railway.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Railway</a>.
                    Google OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest using Fernet symmetric encryption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Optional End-to-End Encryption:</strong>
                    If you enable encryption, your task titles and descriptions are encrypted
                    client-side before storage. We cannot read encrypted content, and we
                    cannot recover your data if you lose your passphrase and passkey.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties.
                    Your data is only accessed by the following services as necessary to
                    operate the Service:

                    <li><strong>Railway</strong> &mdash; application and database hosting</li>
                    <li><strong>Sentry</strong> &mdash; error monitoring (no user content is sent, only error metadata)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
                <p>
                    Your data is retained for as long as your account exists. You can delete
                    your account and all associated data at any time from the Settings page.
                    Account deletion is immediate and irreversible &mdash; all tasks, preferences,
                    and stored tokens are permanently removed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also revoke Whendoist's access to your Google account at any time

                <p>
                    We use a session cookie to keep you signed in. We use a short-lived
                    cookie during the Google OAuth flow (state parameter) to prevent
                    cross-site request forgery. We do not use tracking cookies,
                    third-party cookies, or analytics cookies.

                    collect personal information from children under 13.
